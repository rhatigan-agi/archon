# Contributing to Archon

Thanks for your interest in Archon!

## Current Status

Archon is in active development. The CLI is not yet public, but the design is stable and we welcome feedback.

## How to Contribute Now

### Discussions

The best way to contribute right now is through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rhatigan-agi/archon/discussions):

- **Philosophy & Design** — Questions about the compiler approach, governance model, or overall architecture
- **Feature Ideas** — Suggestions for capabilities you'd like to see
- **Use Cases** — Share how you'd use Archon in your workflow
- **Edge Cases** — Scenarios you think the design doesn't handle well

### Issues

Open an issue for:

- Gaps in the example artifacts
- Unclear documentation
- Questions about specific governance rules
- Inconsistencies you've spotted

### Star & Watch

Star the repo to signal interest and watch for release notifications.

## How to Contribute Later (Post-Release)

Once the CLI is public:

- **Bug Reports** — With reproducible steps
- **Pull Requests** — Bug fixes, scanner improvements, new language support
- **Documentation** — Improvements to docs, examples, tutorials
- **Governance Patterns** — Domain-specific rule templates (healthcare, finance, etc.)

## What We're Not Looking For (Yet)

- Code PRs (nothing to merge into yet)
- Feature requests without context (tell us your use case)
- Comparisons to other tools (we know the landscape)

## Code of Conduct

Be constructive and respectful. We're building something new and welcome good-faith critique.
